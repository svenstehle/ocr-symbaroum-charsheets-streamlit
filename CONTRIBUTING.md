Contributing to ocr-symbaroum-charsheets-streamlit
==================================================

There are many ways to contribute to this project,
e.g. contribution of code or documentation are very welcome. Improving the
documentation is no less important than improving the app itself. If you
find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to 
submit a GitHub pull request. So far the documentation is just a readme,
since we do not offer an API and host our app on streamlit share.

Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs
up" on issues that others reported and that are relevant to you. It also helps
us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles,
link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
